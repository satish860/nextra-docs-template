CHAPTER V. ---- OF DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE

15. Proof of contents of documents. ---- The contents of documents may
    be proved either by primary or by secondary evidence.

16. Primary evidence. ---- Primary evidence means the document itself
    produced for the inspection of the Court.\
    Explanation 1. ----Where a document is executed in several parts,
    each part is primary evidence of the document. Where a document is
    executed in counterpart, each counterpart being executed by one or
    some of the parties only, each counterpart is primary evidence as
    against the parties executing it.\
    Explanation 2. ---- Where a number of documents are all made by one
    uniform process, as in the case of printing, lithography or
    photography, each is primary evidence of the contents of the rest;
    but, where they are all copies of a common original, they are not
    primary evidence of the contents of the original.

17. Subs. by Act 21 of 2000, s. 92 and the Second Schedule, for
    "Contents of documents" (w.e.f. 17-10-2000).\
    33 Illustration A person is shown to have been in possession of a
    number of placards, all printed at one time from one original. Any
    one of the placards is primary evidence of the contents of any
    other, but no one of them is primary evidence of the contents of the
    original.

18. Secondary evidence. ---- Secondary evidence means and includes ----

    such copies;\
(3) copies made from or compared with the original;
(4) counterparts of documents as against the parties who did not execute
    them;

```
(a) A photograph of an original is secondary evidence of its contents,
    though the two have not been compared, if it is proved that the
    thing photographed was the original.\
(b) A copy compared with a copy of a letter made by a copying machine is
    secondary evidence of the contents of the letter, if it is shown
    that the copy made by the copying machine was made from the
    original.
(c) A copy transcribed from a copy, but afterwards compared with the
    original, is secondary evidence; but the copy not so compared is not
    secondary evidence of the original, although the copy from which it
    was transcribed was compared with the original.\
(d) Neither an oral account of a copy compared with the original, nor an
    oral account of a photograph or machine-copy of the original, is
    secondary evidence of the original.

     part of such document, which purports to be in the handwriting of
     any particular person, is in that person's handwriting, and, in the
     case of a document executed or attested, that it was duly executed
     and attested by the persons by whom it purports to be executed and
     attested.\
     Explanation.---- Documents are said to be in proper custody if they
     are in the place in which, and under the care of the person with
     whom, they would naturally be; but no custody is improper if it is
     proved to have had a legitimate origin, or if the circumstances of
     the particular case are such as to render such an origin probable.\
