    have been reduced to the form of a document, and in all cases in
    which any matter is required by law to be reduced to the form of a
    document, no evidence shall be given in proof of the terms of such

92. Exclusion of evidence of oral agreement. ---- When the terms of any
    such contract, grant or other disposition of property, or any matter
    required by law to be reduced to the form of a document, have been
    proved according to the last section, no evidence of any oral
    agreement or statement shall be admitted, as between the parties to
    any such instrument or their representatives in interest, for the
    purpose of contradicting, varying, adding to, or subtracting from,
    its terms:\
    Proviso (1). ---- Any fact may be proved which would invalidate any
    document, or which would entitle any person to any decree or order
    relating thereto; such as fraud, intimidation, illegality, want of
    due execution, want of capacity in any contracting party, 1\[want or
    failure\] of consideration, or mistake in fact or law.\
    Proviso (2). ----The existence of any separate oral agreement as to
    any matter on which a document is silent, and which is not

    or not this proviso applies, the Court shall have regard to the
    degree of formality of the document.\

    the language of a document is related to existing facts.\

(a) A policy of insurance is effected on goods "in ships from Calcutta
    to London". The goods are shipped in a particular ship which is
    lost. The fact that particular ship was orally excepted from the
    policy, cannot be proved.
(b) A agrees absolutely in writing to pay B Rs. 1,000 on the first
    March 1873. The fact that, at the same time, an oral agreement was
    made that the money should not be paid till the thirty-first March,
    cannot be proved.
(c) An estate called "the Rampore tea estate" is sold by a deed which
    contains a map of the property sold. The fact that land not included
    in the map had always been regarded as part of the estate and was
    meant to pass by the deed cannot be proved.

(d) A enters into a written contract with B to work certain mines, the
    property of B, upon certain terms. A was induced to do so by a
    misrepresentation of B's as to their value. This fact may be
    proved.\
(e) A institutes a suit against B for the specific performance of a
    contract, and also prays that the contract may be reformed as to one
    of its provisions, as that provision was inserted in it by mistake.
    A may prove that such a mistake was made as would by law entitle him
    to have the contract reformed.\
(f) A orders goods of B by a letter in which nothing is said as to the
    time of payment, and accepts the goods on delivery. B sues A for the
    price. A may show that the goods were supplied on credit for a term
    still unexpired.\
(g) A sells B a horse and verbally warrants him sound. A gives B a paper
    in these words: "Bought of A a horse of Rs. 500". B may prove the
    verbal warranty.\
(h) A hires lodgings of B, and gives B a card on which is written
    ----"Rooms, Rs. 200 a month." A may prove a verbal agreement that
    these terms were to include partial board.\
    A hires lodgings of B for a year, and a regularly stamped agreement,
    drawn up by an attorney, is made between them. It is silent on the
    subject of board. A may not prove that board was included in the
    term verbally.\
(i) A applies to B for a debt due to A by sending a receipt for the
    money. B keeps the receipt and does not send the money. In a suit
    for the amount, A may prove this.
(j) A and B make a contract in writing to take effect upon the happening
    of a certain contingency. The writing is left with B, who sues A
    upon it. A may show the circumstances under which it was delivered.

93. Exclusion of evidence to explain or amend ambiguous document. ----
    When the language used in a document is, on its face, ambiguous or
    defective, evidence may not be given of facts which would show its
    meaning or supply its defects.\

(a) A agrees, in writing, to sell a horse to B for "Rs. 1,000 or Rs.
    1,500". Evidence cannot be given to show which price was to be
    given.\
(b) A deed contains blanks. Evidence cannot be given of facts which
    would show how they were meant to be filled.

94. Exclusion of evidence against application of document to existing
    facts. ---- When language used in a document is plain in itself, and
    when it applies accurately to existing facts, evidence may not be
    given to show that it was not meant to apply to such facts.
    Illustration A sells to B, by deed, "my estate at Rampur containing
    100 bighas". A has an estate at Rampur containing\
    100 bighas. Evidence may not be given of the fact that the estate
    meant to be sold was one situated at a different place and of a
    different size.
95. Evidence as to document unmeaning reference to existing facts. ----
    When language used in a document is plain in itself, but is
    unmeaning in reference to existing facts, evidence may be given to
    show that it was used in a peculiar sense.\
    Illustration A sells to B, by deed, "my house in Calcutta".\
    A had no house in Calcutta, but it appears that he had a house at
    Howrah, of which B had been in possession since the execution of the
    deed.\
    These facts may be proved to show that the deed related to the house
    at Howrah. 45
96. Evidence as to application of language which can apply to one only
    of several\
    persons. ---- When the facts are such that the language used might
    have been meant to apply to any one, and could not have been meant
    to apply to more than one, of several persons or things, evidence
    may be given of facts which show which of those persons or things it
    was intended to apply to.\

(a) A agrees to sell to B, for Rs. 1,000, "my white horse". A has two
    white horses. Evidence may be give of facts which show which of them
    was meant.\
(b) A agrees to accompany B to Haidarabad. Evidence may be given of
    facts showing whether Haidarabad in the Dekkhan or Haiderabad in
    Sind was meant.

97. Evidence as to application of language to one of two sets of facts,
    to neither of which the whole correctly applies. ---- When the
    language used applies partly to one set of existing facts, and
    partly to another set of existing facts, but the whole of it does
    not apply correctly to either, evidence may be given to show to
    which of the two it was meant to apply.\
    Illustration A agrees to sell to B "my land at X in the occupation
    of Y". A has land at X, but not in the occupation of Y, and he has
    land in the occupation of Y but it is not at X. Evidence may be
    given of facts showing which he meant to sell.
98. Evidence as to meaning of illegible characters, etc. ---- Evidence
    may be given to show the meaning of illegible or not commonly
    intelligible characters, of foreign, obsolete, technical, local and
    provincial expressions, of abbreviations and of words used in a
    peculiar sense. Illustration A, sculptor, agrees to sell to B, "all
    my mods". A has both models and modelling tools. Evidence may be
    given to show which he meant to sell.
99. Who may give evidence of agreement varying terms of
    document.----Persons who are not parties to a document, or their
    representatives in interest, may give evidence of any facts tending
    to show a contemporaneous agreement varying the terms of the
    document.\
    Illustration A and B make a contract in writing that B shall sell A
    certain cotton, to be paid for on delivery. At the same time they
    make an oral agreement that three months credit shall be given to A.
    This could not be shown as between A and B, but it might be shown by
    C, if it affected his interests.
100. Saving of provisions of Indian Succession Act relating to
     wills.----Nothing in this Chapter contained shall be taken to
     affect any of the provisions of the Indian Succession Act,\
     1865 1(10 of 1865) as to the construction of wills.
