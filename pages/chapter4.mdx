CHAPTER IV.---- OF ORAL EVIDENCE

13. Proof of facts by oral evidence. ---- All facts, except the
    1\[contents of documents or electronic records\], may be proved by
    oral evidence.

14. Oral evidence must be direct. ---- Oral evidence must, in all cases
    whatever, be direct; that is to say ---- if it refers to a fact
    which could be seen, it must be the evidence of a witness who says
    he saw it; if it refers to a fact which could be heard, it must be
    the evidence of a witness who says he heard it; if it refers to a
    fact which could be perceived by any other sense or in any other
    manner, it must be the evidence of a witness who says he perceived
    it by that sense or in that manner;\
    if it refers to an opinion or to the grounds on which that opinion
    is held, it must be the evidence of the person who holds that
    opinion on those grounds:\
    Provided that the opinions of experts expressed in any treatise
    commonly offered for sale, and the grounds on which such opinions
    are held, may be proved by the production of such treatises if the
    author is dead or cannot be found, or has become incapable of giving
    evidence, or cannot be called as a witness without an amount of
    delay or expense which the Court regards as unreasonable: Provided
    also that, if oral evidence refers to the existence or condition of
    any material thing other than a document, the Court may, if it
    thinks fit, require the production of such material thing for its
    inspection.
