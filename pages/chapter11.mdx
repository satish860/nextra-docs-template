CHAPTER XI---- OF
     IMPROPER ADMISSION AND REJECTION OF EVIDENCE

170. No new trial for improper admission or rejection of evidence. ----
     The improper admission or rejection of evidence shall not be ground
     of itself for a new trial or reversal of any decision in any case,
     if it shall appear to the Court before which such objection is
     raised that, independently of the evidence objected to and
     admitted, there was sufficient evidence to justify the decision, or
     that, if the rejected evidence had been received, it ought not to
     have varied the decision. THE SCHEDULE. ---- \[Enactments
     repealed.\] Rep.Â by the Repealing Act, 1938 (1 of 1938), s. 2 and
     the Schedule.
