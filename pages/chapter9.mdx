CHAPTER IX. ---- OF WITNESSES

119. Who may testify. ---- All persons shall be competent to testify
     unless the Court considers that they are prevented from
     understanding the questions put to them, or from giving rational
     answers to those\
     questions, by tender years, extreme old age, disease, whether of
     body or mind, or any other cause of the same kind.\
     Explanation. ---- A lunatic is not incompetent to testify, unless
     he is prevented by his lunacy from understanding the questions put
     to him and giving rational answers to them. 1\[119. Witness unable
     to communicate verbally. ---- A witness who is unable to speak may
     give his evidence in any other manner in which he can make it
     intelligible, as by writing or by signs; but such writing must be
     written and the signs made in open Court, evidence so given shall
     be deemed to be oral evidence: Provided that if the witness is
     unable to communicate verbally, the Court shall take the assistance
     of an interpreter or a special educator in recording the statement,
     and such statement shall be video graphed.\]

120. Parties to civil suit, and their wives or husbands. Husband or wife
     of person under criminal trial. ---- In all civil proceedings the
     parties to the suit, and the husband or wife of any party to the
     suit, shall be competent witnesses. In criminal proceedings against
     any person, the husband or wife of such person, respectively, shall
     be a competent witness.

121. Judges and Magistrates. ---- No Judge or Magistrate shall, except
     upon the special order of some Court to which he is subordinate, be
     compelled to answer any questions as to his own conduct in Court as
     such Judge or Magistrate, or as to anything which came to his
     knowledge in Court as such Judge or Magistrate; but he may be
     examined as to other matters which occurred in his presence whilst
     he was so acting.\

     or vakil, shall at any time be permitted, unless with his client's
     express consent, to disclose any communication made to him in the
     course and for the purpose of his employment as such barrister,
     pleader, attorney or vakil, by or on behalf of his client, or to

(1) any such communication made in furtherance of any 2\[illegal\]
    purpose,\
(2) any fact observed by any barrister, pleader, attorney or vakil, in
    the course of his employment as such, showing that any crime or
    fraud has been committed since the commencement of his employment.\
    It is immaterial whether the attention of such barrister,
    3\[pleader\], attorney or vakil was or was not directed to such fact
    by or on behalf of his client.\

```
(a) A, a client, says to B, an attorney ---- "I have committed forgery,
    and I wish you to defend me."\
    As the defence of a man known to be guilty is not a criminal
    purpose, this communication is protected from disclosure.\
(b) A, a client, says to B, an attorney ---- "I wish to obtain
    possession of property by the use of a forged deed on which I
    request you to sue."\
    This communication, being made in furtherance of a criminal purpose,
    is not protected from disclosure.\
(c) A, being charged with embezzlement, retains B, an attorney, to
    defend him. In the course of the proceedings, B observes that an
    entry has been made in A's account book, charging A with the sum
    said to have been embezzled, which entry was not in the book at the
    commencement of his employment.\
    This being a fact observed by B in the course of his employment,
    showing that a fraud has been committed since the commencement of
    the proceedings, it is not protected from disclosure.

     section 126 shall apply to interpreters, and the clerks or servants
     of barristers, pleaders, attorneys and vakils.

128. Privilege not waived by volunteering evidence. ---- If any party to
     a suit gives evidence therein at his own instance or otherwise, he
     shall not be deemed to have consented thereby to such disclosure\
     as is mentioned in section 126; and, if any party to a suit or
     proceeding calls any such barrister,

129. Subs. by Act 3 of 1887, s. 1, for the original s. 125.

130. Subs. by Act 18 of 1872, s. 10, for "criminal".\

131. Ins. by s. 10, ibid. 53 1\[pleader\], attorney or vakil as a
     witness, he shall be deemed to have consented to such disclosure
     only if he questions such barrister, attorney or vakil on matters
     which, but for such question, he would not be at liberty to
     disclose.

132. Confidential communications with legal advisers. ---- No one shall
     be compelled to disclose to the Court any confidential
     communication which has taken place between him and his legal
     professional adviser, unless he offers himself as a witness, in
     which case he may be compelled to disclose any such communications
     as may appear to the Court necessary to be known in order to
     explain any evidence which he has given, but no others.

133. Production of title-deeds of witness not a party. ---- No witness
     who is not a party to a suit shall be compelled to produce his
     title-deeds to any property, or any document in virtue of which he
     holds any property as pledge or mortgagee or any document the
     production of which might tend to criminate him, unless he has
     agreed in writing to produce them with the person seeking the
     production of such deeds or some person through whom he claims.
     2\[131. Production of documents or electronic records which another
     person, having possession, could refuse to produce. ---- No one
     shall be compelled to produce documents in his possession or
     electronic records under his control, which any other person would
     be entitled to refuse to produce if they were in his possession or
     control, unless such last-mentioned person consents to their
     production.\]

134. Witness not excused from answering on ground that answer will
     criminate. ---- A witness shall not be excused from answering any
     question as to any matter relevant to the matter in issue in any
     suit or in any civil or criminal proceeding, upon the ground that
     the answer to such question will criminate, or may tend directly or
     indirectly to criminate, such witness, or that it will expose, or
     tend directly or indirectly to expose, such witness to a penalty or
     forfeiture of any kind:\
     Proviso. ---- Provided that no such answer, which a witness shall
     be compelled to give, shall subject him to any arrest or
     prosecution, or be proved against him in any criminal proceeding,
     except a prosecution for giving false evidence by such answer.

135. Accomplice. ---- An accomplice shall be a competent witness against
     an accused person; and a conviction is not illegal merely because
     it proceeds upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice.

136. Number of witnesses. ---- No particular number of witnesses shall
     in any case be required for the proof of any fact.
