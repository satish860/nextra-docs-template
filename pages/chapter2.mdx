(a) A is tried for the murder of B by beating him with a club with the
    intention of causing his death. At A's trial the following facts are
    in issue:----\
    A's beating B with the club; A's causing B's death by such beating;\
    A's intention to cause B's death.\
(b) A suitor does not bring with him, and have in readiness for
    production at the first hearing of the case, a bond on which he
    relies. This section does not enable him to produce the bond or
    prove its contents at a subsequent stage of the proceedings,
    otherwise than in accordance with the conditions prescribed by the
    Code of Civil Procedure5.

6.  Relevancy of facts forming part of same transaction.----Facts which,
    though not in issue, are so connected with a fact in issue as to
    form part of the same transaction, are relevant, whether they
    occurred at the same time and place or at different times and
    places. Illustrations\

```
(a) A is accused of the murder of B by beating him. Whatever was said or
    done by A or B or the by-standers at the beating, or so shortly
    before or after it as to form part of the transaction, is a relevant
    fact.

(b) A is accused of waging war against the 1\[Government of India\] by
    taking part in an armed insurrection in which property is destroyed,
    troops are attacked and gaols are broken open. The occurrence of
    these facts is relevant, as forming part of the general transaction,
    though A may not have been present at all of them.\
(c) A sues B for a libel contained in a letter forming part of a
    correspondence. Letters between the parties relating to the subject
    out of which the libel arose, and forming part of the correspondence
    in which it is contained, are relevant facts, though they do not
    contain the libel itself.
(d) The question is, whether certain goods ordered from B were delivered
    to A. The goods were delivered to several intermediate persons
    successively. Each delivery is a relevant fact.

    ---- Facts which are the occasion, cause or effect, immediate or
    otherwise, of relevant facts, or facts in issue, or which constitute
    the state of things under which they happened, or which afforded an
    opportunity for their occurrence or transaction, are relevant.\

(a) The question is, whether A robbed B.\
    The facts that, shortly before the robbery, B went to a fair with
    money in his possession, and that he showed it, or mentioned the
    fact that he had it, to third persons, are relevant.
(b) The question is, whether A murdered B.\
    Marks on the ground, produced by a struggle at or near the place
    where the murder was committed, are relevant facts.\
(c) The question is, whether A poisoned B.\
    The state of B's health before the symptoms ascribed to poison, and
    habits of B, known to A, which afforded an opportunity for the
    administration of poison, are relevant facts.

8.  Motive, preparation and previous or subsequent conduct.----Any fact
    is relevant which shows or constitutes a motive or preparation for
    any fact in issue or relevant fact. The conduct of any party, or of
    any agent to any party, to any suit or proceeding, in reference to
    such suit or proceeding, or in reference to any fact in issue
    therein or relevant thereto, and the conduct of any person an
    offence against whom is the subject of any proceeding, is relevant,
    if such conduct influences or is influenced by any fact in issue or
    relevant fact, and whether it was previous or subsequent thereto.\
    Explanation 1.----The word "conduct" in this section does not
    include statements, unless those statements accompany and explain
    acts other than statements; but this explanation is not to affect
    the\
    relevancy of statements under any other section of this Act.\
    Explanation 2.----When the conduct of any person is relevant, any
    statement made to him or in his presence and hearing, which affects
    such conduct, is relevant.\

(a) A is tried for the murder of B.\
    The facts that A murdered C, that B knew that A had murdered C, and
    that B had tried to extort money from A by threatening to make his
    knowledge public, are relevant.\
(b) A sues B upon a bond for the payment of money, B denies the making
    of the bond.

1.  Subs. by the A.O. 1950, for "Queen".\
    13 The fact that, at the time when the bond was alleged to be made,
    B required money for a particular purpose, is relevant.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
(c) A is tried for the murder of B by poison. The fact that, before the
    death of B, A procured poison similar to that which was administered
    to B, is relevant.\
(d) The question is, whether a certain document is the will of A.\
    The facts that, not long before, the date of the alleged will, A
    made inquiry into matters to which the provisions of the alleged
    will relate; that he consulted vakils in reference to making the
    will, and that he caused drafts of other wills to be prepared, of
    which he did not approve, are relevant.\
(e) A is accused of a crime.\
    The facts that, either before, or at the time of, or after the
    alleged crime, A provided evidence which would tend to give to the
    facts of the case an appearance favourable to himself, or that he
    destroyed or concealed evidence, or prevented the presence or
    procured the absence of persons who might have been witnesses, or
    suborned persons to give false evidence respecting it, are
    relevant.\
(f) The question is, whether A robbed B.\
    The facts that, after B was robbed, C said in A's presence ---- "the
    police are coming to look for the man who robbed B," and that
    immediately afterwards A ran away, are relevant.\
(g) The question is, whether A owes B rupees 10,000. The facts that A
    asked C to lend him money, and that D said to C in A's presence and
    hearing---- "I advise you not to trust A, for he owes B 10,000
    rupees," and that A went away without making any answer, are
    relevant facts.\
(h) The question is, whether A committed a crime. The fact that A
    absconded, after receiving a letter, warning him that inquiry was
    being made for the criminal, and the contents of the letter, are
    relevant.
(i) A is accused of a crime. The facts that, after the commission of the
    alleged crime, he absconded, or was in possession of property or the
    proceeds of property acquired by the crime, or attempted to conceal
    things which were or might have been used in committing it, are
    relevant.
(j) The question is, whether A was ravished.\
    The facts that, shortly after the alleged rape, she made a complaint
    relating to the crime, the circumstances under which, and the terms
    in which, the complaint was made, are relevant. The fact that,
    without making a complaint, she said that she had been ravished is
    not relevant as conduct under this section, though it may be
    relevant as a dying declaration under section 32, clause (1), or as
    corroborative evidence under section 157.
(k) The question is, whether A was robbed.\
    The fact that, soon after the alleged robbery, he made a complaint
    relating to the offence, the circumstances under which, and the
    terms in which, the complaint was made, are relevant.\
    14 The fact that he said he had been robbed, without making any
    complaint, is not relevant, as conduct under this section, though it
    may be relevant as a dying declaration under section 32, clause (1),
    or as corroborative evidence under section 157.

9.  Facts necessary to explain or introduce relevant facts.----Facts
    necessary to explain or introduce a fact in issue or relevant fact,
    or which support or rebut an inference suggested by a fact in issue
    or relevant fact, or which establish the identity of any thing or
    person whose identity is relevant, or fix the time or place at which
    any fact in issue or relevant fact happened, or which show the
    relation of parties by whom any such fact was transacted, are
    relevant in so far as they are necessary for that purpose.\
    Illustrations

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
(a) The question is, whether a given document is the will of A.\
    The state of A's property and of his family at the date of the
    alleged will may be relevant facts.\
(b) A sues B for a libel imputing disgraceful conduct to A; B affirms
    that the matter alleged to be libellous is true.\
    The position and relations of the parties at the time when the libel
    was published may be relevant facts as introductory to the facts in
    issue.\
    The particulars of a dispute between A and B about a matter
    unconnected with the alleged libel are irrelevant, though the fact
    that there was a dispute may be relevant if it affected the
    relations between A and B.\
(c) A is accused of a crime.\
    The fact that, soon after the commission of the crime, A absconded
    from his house, is relevant under section 8, as conduct subsequent
    to and affected by facts in issue. The fact that, at the time when
    he left home, he had sudden and urgent business at the place to
    which he went, is relevant, as tending to explain the fact that he
    left home suddenly.\
    The details of the business on which he left are not relevant,
    except in so far as they are necessary to show that the business was
    sudden and urgent.
(d) A sues B for inducing C to break a contract of service made by him
    with A. C, on leaving A's service, says to A ---- "I am leaving you
    because B has made me a better offer." This statement is a relevant
    fact as explanatory of C's conduct, which is relevant as a fact in
    issue.
(e) A, accused of theft, is seen to give the stolen property to B, who
    is seen to give it to A's wife. B says as he delivers it----"A says
    you are to hide this." B's statement is relevant as explanatory of a
    fact which is part of the transaction.
(f) A is tried for a riot and is proved to have marched at the head of a
    mob. The cries of the mob are relevant as explanatory of the nature
    of the transaction.

10. Things said or done by conspirator in reference to common
    design.----Where there is reasonable ground to believe that two or
    more persons have conspired together to commit an offence or an
    actionable wrong, anything said, done or written by any one of such
    persons in reference to their common intention, after the time when
    such intention was first entertained by any one of them, is a
    relevant fact as against each of the persons believed to be so
    conspiring, as well for the purpose of proving the existence of the
    conspiracy as for the purpose of showing that any such person was a
    party to it.

15 Illustrations Reasonable ground exists for believing that A has
joined in a conspiracy to wage war against the 1\[Government of
India\].\
The facts that B procured arms in Europe for the purpose of the
conspiracy, C collected money in Calcutta for a like object, D persuaded
persons to join the conspiracy in Bombay, E published writings
advocating the object in view at Agra, and F transmitted from Delhi to G
at Kabul the money which C had collected at Calcutta, and the contents
of a letter written by H giving an account of the conspiracy, are each
relevant, both to prove the existence of the conspiracy, and to prove
A's complicity in it, although he may have been ignorant of all of them,
and although the persons by whom they were done were strangers to him,
and although they may have taken place before he joined the conspiracy
or after he left it. 11. When facts not otherwise relevant become
relevant.----Facts not otherwise relevant are\
relevant----\
(1) if they are inconsistent with any fact in issue or relevant fact;\
(2) if by themselves or in connection with other facts they make the
existence or non-existence of any fact in issue or relevant fact highly
probable or improbable.\
Illustrations (a) The question is, whether A committed a crime at
Calcutta on a certain day.\
The fact that, on that day, A was at Lahore is relevant.\
The fact that, near the time when the crime was committed, A was at a
distance from the place where it was committed, which would render it
highly improbable, though not impossible, that he committed it, is
relevant. (b) The question is, whether A committed a crime.\
The circumstances are such that the crime must have been committed
either by A, B, C or D. Every fact which shows that the crime could have
been committed by no one else, and that it was not committed by either
B, C or D, is relevant. 12. In suits for damages, facts tending to
enable Court to determine amount are relevant. ---- In suits in which
damages are claimed, any fact which will enable the Court to determine
the amount of damages which ought to be awarded, is relevant. 13. Facts
relevant when right or custom is in question.----Where the question is
as to the existence of any right or custom, the following facts are
relevant:----\
(a) any transaction by which the right or custom in question was
created, claimed, modified, recognised, asserted or denied, or which was
inconsistent with its existence; (b) particular instances in which the
right or custom was claimed, recognised or exercised, or in which its
exercise was disputed, asserted or departed from.

1.  Subs. by the A.O. 1950, for "Queen". 16 Illustrations The question
    is, whether A has a right to a fishery.\
    A deed conferring the fishery on A's ancestors, a mortgage of the
    fishery by A's father, a subsequent grant of the fishery by A's
    father, irreconcilable with the mortgage, particular instances in
    which A's father exercised the right, or in which the exercise of
    the right was stopped by A's neighbours, are relevant facts.
2.  Facts showing existence of state of mind, or of body of bodily
    feeling.----Facts showing the existence of any state of mind such as
    intention, knowledge, good faith, negligence, rashness, ill-will or
    good-will towards any particular person, or showing the existence of
    any state of body or bodily feeling, are relevant, when the
    existence of any such state of mind or body or bodily feeling is in
    issue or relevant.\
    1\[Explanation 1.----A fact relevant as showing the existence of a
    relevant state of mind must show that the state of mind exists, not
    generally, but in reference to the particular matter in question.\
    Explanation 2.----But where, upon the trial of a person accused of
    an offence, the previous commission by the accused of an offence is
    relevant within the meaning of this section, the previous conviction
    of such person shall also be a relevant fact.2\] Illustrations

```
(a) A is accused of receiving stolen goods knowing them to be stolen. It
    is proved that he was in possession of a particular stolen article.\
    The fact that, at the same time, he was in possession of many other
    stolen articles is relevant, as tending to show that he knew each
    and all of the articles of which he was in possession to be stolen.\
    3\[(b) A is accused of fraudulently delivering to another person a
    counterfeit coin which, at the time when he delivered it, he knew to
    be counterfeit. The fact that, at the time of its delivery, A was
    possessed of a number of other pieces of counterfeit coin is
    relevant.\
    The fact that A had been previously convicted of delivering to
    another person as genuine a counterfeit coin knowing it to be
    counterfeit is relevant.\]
(b) A sues B for damage done by a dog of B's, which B knew to be
    ferocious. The fact that the dog had previously bitten X, Y and Z,
    and that they had made complaints to B, are relevant.\
(c) The question is, whether A, the acceptor of a bill of exchange, knew
    that the name of the payee was fictitious. The fact that A had
    accepted other bills drawn in the same manner before they could have
    been transmitted to him by the payee if the payee had been a real
    person, is relevant, as showing that A knew that the payee was a
    fictitious person.\
(d) A is accused of defaming B by publishing an imputation intended to
    harm the reputation of B.\
    The fact of previous publications by A respecting B, showing
    ill-will on the part of A towards B is relevant, as proving A's
    intention to harm B's reputation by the particular publication in
    question.

3.  Subs. by Act 3 of 1891, s. 1(2), ibid. for the original Illustration
    (b). 17 The facts that there was no previous quarrel between A and
    B, and that A repeated the matter complained of as he heard it, are
    relevant, as showing that A did not intend to harm the reputation of
    B.

```{=html}

```
(f) A is sued by B for fraudulently representing to B that C was
    solvent, whereby B, being induced to trust C, who was insolvent,
    suffered loss.\
    The fact that, at the time when A represented C to be solvent, C was
    supposed to be solvent by his neighbours and by persons dealing with
    him, is relevant, as showing that A made the representation in good
    faith.
(g) A is sued by B for the price of work done by B, upon a house of
    which A is owner, by the order of C, a contractor.\
    A's defence is that B's contract was with C. The fact that A paid C
    for the work in question is relevant, as proving that A did, in good
    faith, make over to C the management of the work in question, so
    that C was in a position to contract with B on C's own account, and
    not as agent for A.
(h) A is accused of the dishonest misappropriation of property which he
    had found, and the question is whether, when he appropriated it, he
    believed in good faith that the real owner could not be found.\
    The fact that public notice of the loss of the property had been
    given in the place where A was, is relevant, as showing that A did
    not in good faith believe that the real owner of the property could
    not be found.\
    The fact that A knew, or had reason to believe, that the notice was
    given fraudulently by C, who had heard of the loss of the property
    and wished to set up a false claim to it, is relevant, as showing
    that the fact that A knew of the notice did not disprove A's good
    faith.\
(i) A is charged with shooting at B with intent to kill him. In order to
    show A's intent the fact of A's having previously shot at B may be
    proved.
(j) A is charged with sending threatening letters to B. Threatening
    letters previously sent by A to B may be proved, as showing the
    intention of the letters.
(k) The question is, whether A has been guilty of cruelty towards B, his
    wife.\
    Expressions of their feeling towards each other shortly before or
    after the alleged cruelty are relevant facts.\
(l) The question is whether A's death was caused by poison. Statements
    made by A during his illness as to his symptoms are relevant facts.\
(m) The question is, what was the state of A's health at the time when
    an assurance on his life was effected.\
    Statements made by A as to the state of his health at or near the
    time in question are relevant facts.\
(n) A sues B for negligence in providing him with a carriage for hire
    not reasonably fit for use, whereby A was injured. The fact that B's
    attention was drawn on other occasions to the defect of that
    particular carriage is relevant.\
    The fact that B was habitually negligent about the carriages which
    he let to hire is irrelevant.
(o) A is tried for the murder of B by intentionally shooting him dead.
    The fact that A on other occasions shot at B is relevant as showing
    his intention to shoot B.\
    18 The fact that A was in the habit of shooting at people with
    intent to murder them is irrelevant.
(p) A is tried for a crime.\
    The fact that he said something indicating an intention to commit
    that particular crime is relevant. The fact that he said something
    indicating a general disposition to commit crimes of that class is
    irrelevant.

15. Facts bearing on question whether act was accidental or
    intentional.----When there is a question whether an act was
    accidental or intentional, 1\[or done with a particular knowledge or
    intention,\] the fact that such act formed part of a series of
    similar occurrences, in each of which the person doing the act was
    concerned, is relevant. Illustrations

```
(a) A is accused of burning down his house in order to obtain money for
    which it is insured. The facts that A lived in several houses
    successively each of which he insured, in each of which a fire
    occurred, and after each of which fires A received payment from a
    different insurance office, are relevant, as tending to show that
    the fires were not accidental.\
(b) A is employed to receive money from the debtors of B. It is A's duty
    to make entries in a book showing the amounts received by him. He
    makes an entry showing that on a particular occasion he received
    less than he really did receive.\
    The question is, whether this false entry was accidental or
    intentional.\
    The facts that other entries made by A in the same book are false,
    and that the false entry is in each case in favour of A, are
    relevant.\
(c) A is accused of fraudulently delivering to B a counterfeit rupee.\
    The question is, whether the delivery of the rupee was accidental.\
    The facts that, soon before or soon after the delivery to B, A
    delivered counterfeit rupees to C, D and E are relevant, as showing
    that the delivery to B was not accidental

16. Existence of course of business when relevant.----When there is a
    question whether a particular act was done, the existence of any
    course of business, according to which it naturally would have been
    done, is a relevant fact.\
    Illustrations

(a) The question is, whether a particular letter was despatched. The
    facts that it was the ordinary course of business for all letters
    put in a certain place to be carried to the post, and that
    particular letter was put in that place are relevant.\
(b) The question is, whether a particular letter reached A. The facts
    that it was posted in due course, and was not returned through the
    Dead Letter Office, are relevant.

    ----Statements made by persons to whom a party to the suit has
    expressly referred for information in reference to a matter in
    dispute are admissions. Illustration The question is, whether a
    horse sold by A to B is sound.\
    A says to B ---- "Go and ask C, C knows all about it." C's statement
    is an admission.

21. Proof of admissions against persons making them, and by or on their
    behalf.----Admissions are relevant and may be proved as against the
    person who makes them, or his representative in interest;

22. Subs. by Act 21 of 2000, s. 92 and the Second Schedule, for "oral or
    documentary," (w.e.f. 17-10-2000). 20 but they cannot be proved by
    or on behalf of the person who makes them or by his representative
    in interest, except in the following cases:----\

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
(1) An admission may be proved by or on behalf of the person making it,
    when it is of such a nature that, if the person making it were dead,
    it would be relevant as between third persons under section 32.
(2) An admission may be proved by or on behalf of the person making it,
    when it consists of a statement of the existence of any state of
    mind or body, relevant or in issue, made at or about the time when
    such state of mind or body existed, and is accompanied by conduct
    rendering its falsehood improbable.
(3) An admission may be proved by or on behalf of the person making it,
    if it is relevant otherwise than as an admission. Illustrations

```
(a) The question between A and B is whether a certain deed is or is not
    forged. A affirms that it is genuine, B that it is forged.\
    A may prove a statement by B that the deed is genuine, and B may
    prove a statement by A that deed is forged; but A cannot prove a
    statement by himself that the deed is genuine, nor can B prove a
    statement by himself that the deed is forged.
(b) A, the captain of a ship, is tried for casting her away.\
    Evidence is given to show that the ship was taken out of her proper
    course.\
    A produces a book kept by him in the ordinary course of his business
    showing observations alleged to have been taken by him from day to
    day, and indicating that the ship was not taken out of her proper
    course. A may prove these statements, because they would be
    admissible between third parties, if he were dead, under section 32,
    clause (2).\
(c) A is accused of a crime committed by him at Calcutta. He produces a
    letter written by himself and dated at Lahore on that day, and
    bearing the Lahore post-mark of that day.\
    The statement in the date of the letter is admissible, because, if A
    were dead, it would be admissible under section 32, clause (2).\
(d) A is accused of receiving stolen goods knowing them to be stolen.\
    He offers to prove that he refused to sell them below their value.\
    A may prove these statements, though they are admissions, because
    they are explanatory of conduct influenced by facts in issue.\
(e) A is accused of fraudulently having in his possession counterfeit
    coin which he knew to be counterfeit. He offers to prove that he
    asked a skilful person to examine the coin as he doubted whether it
    was counterfeit or not, and that that person did examine it and told
    him it was genuine. A may prove these facts for the reasons stated
    in the last preceding illustration.

22. When oral admissions as to contents of documents are
    relevant.----Oral admissions as to the contents of a document are
    not relevant, unless and until the party proposing to prove them
    shows that he 21 is entitled to give secondary evidence of the
    contents of such document under the rules hereinafter contained, or
    unless the genuineness of a document produced is in question.
    1\[22A. When oral admission as to contents of electronic records are
    relevant.----Oral admissions as to the contents of electronic
    records are not relevant, unless the genuineness of the electronic
    record produced is in question.\]

23. Admissions in civil cases when relevant.----In civil cases no
    admission is relevant, if it is made either upon an express
    condition that evidence of it is not to be given, or under
    circumstances from which the Court can infer that the parties agreed
    together that evidence of it should not be given.\
    Explanation.----Nothing in this section shall be taken to exempt any
    barrister, pleader, attorney or vakil from giving evidence of any
    matter of which he may be compelled to give evidence under\
    section 126.

24. Confession caused by inducement, threat or promise, when irrelevant
    in criminal proceeding.----A confession made by an accused person is
    irrelevant in a criminal proceeding, if the making of the confession
    appears to the Court to have been caused by any inducement, threat
    or 2promise having reference to the charge against the accused
    person, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient, in the
    opinion of the Court, to give the accused person grounds which would
    appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making it he would
    gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in
    reference to the proceedings against him.

25. Confession to police-officer not to be proved.----No confession made
    to a police-officer3, shall be proved as against a person accused of
    any offence.

26. Confession by accused while in custody of police not to be proved
    against him.----No confession made by any person whilst he is in the
    custody of a police-officer, unless it be made in the immediate
    presence of a Magistrate4, shall be proved as against such person.
    5\[Explanation.----In this section "Magistrate" does not include the
    head of a village discharging magisterial functions in the
    Presidency of Fort St. George 6\*\*\* or elsewhere, unless such
    headman is a Magistrate exercising the powers of a Magistrate under
    the Code of Criminal Procedure,\
    18827 (10 of 1882).\]

27. How much of information received from accused may be
    proved.----Provided that, when any fact is deposed to as discovered
    inconsequence of information received from a person accused of any
    offence, in the custody of a police-officer, so much of such
    information, whether it amounts to a confession or not, as relates
    distinctly to the fact thereby discovered, may be proved.

28. Confession made after removal of impression caused by inducement,
    threat or promise, relevant.----If such a confession as is referred
    to in section 24 is made after the impression caused by any such
    inducement, threat or promise has, in the opinion of the Court, been
    fully removed, it is relevant.

29. Confession otherwise relevant not to become irrelevant because of
    promise of secrecy,\
    etc.----If such a confession is otherwise relevant, it does not
    become irrelevant merely because it was made under a promise of
    secrecy, or in consequence of a deception practiced on the accused
    person for the purpose of obtaining it, or when he was drunk, or
    because it was made in answer to questions which

    questions, or because he was not warned that he was not bound to
    make such confession, and that evidence of it might be given against
    him.
8.  Consideration of proved confession affecting person making it and
    others jointly under trial for same offence.----When more persons
    than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a
    confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some
    other of such persons is proved, the Court may take into
    consideration such confession as against such other person as well
    as against the person who makes such confession.

(a) A and B are jointly tried for the murder of C. It is proved that A
    said----"B and I murdered C". The Court may consider the effect of
    this confession as against B.\
(b) A is on his trial for the murder of C. There is evidence to show
    that C was murdered by A and B, and that B said ----"A and I
    murdered C".\
    This statement may not be taken into consideration by the Court
    against A, as B is not being jointly tried.

    not conclusive proof of the matters admitted but they may operate as
    estoppels under the provisions hereinafter contained. STATEMENTS BY
    PERSONS WHO CANNOT BE CALLED AS WITNESSES
32. Cases in which statement of relevant fact by person who is dead or
    cannot be found, etc., is relevant. ---- Statements, written or
    verbal, of relevant facts made by a person who is dead, or who
    cannot be found, or who has become incapable of giving evidence, or
    whose attendance cannot be procured without an amount of delay or

    question.\
    Such statements are relevant whether the person who made them was or

    death, and whatever may be the nature of the proceeding in which the
    cause of his death comes into question.
(2) or is made in course of business.----When the statement was made by

(a) The question is, whether A was murdered by B; or A dies of injuries
    received in a transaction in the course of which she was ravished.

    whether A was killed by B under such circumstances that a suit would
    lie against B by A's widow.\
    Statements made by A as to the cause of his or her death, referring
    respectively to the murder, the rape and the actionable wrong under
    consideration, are relevant facts.\
(b) The question is as to the date of A's birth. An entry in the diary
    of a deceased surgeon regularly kept in the course of business,
    stating that, on a given day he attended A's mother and delivered
    her of a son, is a relevant fact.

    protest made by the Captain, whose attendance cannot be procured, is
    a relevant fact.\

33. Relevancy of certain evidence for proving, in subsequent proceeding,
    the truth of facts therein stated.----Evidence given by a witness in
    a judicial proceeding, or before any person authorised by law to
    take it, is relevant for the purpose of proving, in a subsequent
    judicial proceeding, or in a later stage of the same judicial
    proceeding, the truth of the facts which it states, when the witness
    is dead or cannot be found, or is incapable of giving evidence, or
    is kept out of the way by the adverse party, or if his presence
    cannot be obtained without an amount of delay or expense which,
    under the circumstances of the case, the Court considers
    unreasonable:\
    Provided ----\
    that the proceeding was between the same parties or their
    representatives in interest; that the adverse party in the first
    proceeding had the right and opportunity to cross-examine;\

    books of account, including those maintained in an electronic
    form\], regularly kept in the course of business, are relevant
    whenever they refer to a matter into which the Court has to inquire,
    but such statements shall not alone be sufficient evidence to charge
    any person with liability. Illustration A sues B for Rs. 1,000, and
    shows entries in his account books showing B to be indebted to him
    to this amount. The entries are relevant, but are not sufficient,
    without other evidence, to prove the debt.

    facts in issue or relevant facts, made in published maps or charts
    generally offered for public sale, or in maps or plans made under
    the authority of 3\[the Central Government or any State
    Government\], as to matters usually represented or stated in such
    maps, charts or plans, are themselves relevant facts.
37. Relevancy of statement as to fact of public nature contained in
    certain Acts or\
    notifications. ----When the Court has to form an opinion as to the
    existence of any fact of a public nature, any statement of it, made
    in a recital contained in any Act of Parliament 4\[of the United
    Kingdom\] or in any 5\[Central Act, Provincial Act or 6\[a State
    Act\] or in a Government notification or notification by the Crown
    Representative appearing in the Official Gazette or in any printed
    paper purporting to be the London Gazette or the Government Gazette

    Gazette of any L.G., or in any printed paper purporting to be the
    London Gazette or the Government Gazette of any colony or possession
    of the Queen, is a relevant fact". This was amended first by the
    Repealing and Amending Act, 1914 (10 of 1914), and then by the A.O.
    1937, the A.O. 1948 and the A.O. 1950 to read as above.

    evidence shall be given of so much and no more of the statement,
    conversation, document, electronic record, book or series of letters
    or papers as the Court considers necessary in that particular case
    to the full understanding of the nature and effect of the statement,
    and of the circumstances under which it was made.\] JUDGMENTS OF
    COURTS OF JUSTICE WHEN RELEVANT

47. Previous judgments relevant to bar a second suit or trial.----The
    existence of any judgment, order or decree which by law prevents any
    Court from taking cognizance of a suit or holding a trial, is a
    relevant fact when the question is whether such Court ought to take
    cognizance of such suit or to hold such trial.

48. Relevancy of certain judgments in probate, etc., jurisdiction.----A
    final judgment, order or decree of a competent Court, in the
    exercise of probate, matrimonial, admiralty or insolvency
    jurisdiction, which confers upon or takes away from any person any
    legal character, or which declares any person to be entitled to any
    such character, or to be entitled to any specific thing, not as
    against any specified person but absolutely, is relevant when the
    existence of any such legal character, or the title of any such
    person to any such thing, is relevant. Such judgment, order or
    decree is conclusive proof ----\
    that any legal character which it confers accrued at the time when
    such judgment, order or decree came into operation;\
    that any legal character, to which it declares any such person to be
    entitled, accrued to that person at the time when such judgment
    1\[order or decree\] declares it to have accrued to that person;
    that any legal character which it takes away from any such person
    ceased at the time from which such judgment, 1\[order or decree\]
    declared that it had ceased or should cease; and that anything to
    which it declares any person to be so entitled was the property of
    that person at the time from which such judgment, 1\[order or
    decree\] declares that it had been or should be his property.

49. Relevancy and effect of judgments, orders or decrees, other than
    those mentioned in\
    section 41. ---- Judgments, orders or decrees other than those
    mentioned in section 41 are relevant if they relate to matters of a
    public nature relevant to the enquiry; but such judgments, orders or
    decrees are not conclusive proof of that which they state.\
    Illustration\
    A sues B for trespass on his land. B alleges the existence of a
    public right of way over the land, which A denies.\
    The existence of a decree in favour of the defendant, in a suit by A
    against C for a trespass on the same land, in which C alleged the
    existence of the same right of way, is relevant, but it is not
    conclusive proof that the right of way exists.

50. Judgments, etc., other than those mentioned in sections 40, 41 and
    42, when relevant.---- Judgments, orders or decrees, other than
    those mentioned in sections 40, 41 and 42, are irrelevant, unless
    the existence of such judgment, order or decree is a fact in issue,
    or is relevant under some other provision of this Act.

    to make out his justification. The fact is irrelevant as between B
    and C.
(b) A prosecutes B for adultery with C, A's wife.\
    B denies that C is A's wife, but the Court convicts B of adultery.
    Afterwards, C is prosecuted for bigamy in marrying B during A's
    lifetime.\
    C says that she never was A's wife.\
    The judgment against B is irrelevant as against C.
(c) A prosecutes B for stealing a cow from him. B is convicted.\
    A afterwards sues C for the cow, which B had sold to him before his
    conviction. As between A and C, the judgment against B is
    irrelevant.
(d) A has obtained a decree for the possession of land against B. C, B's
    son, murders A in consequence.\
    The existence of the judgment is relevant, as showing motive for a
    crime. 1\[(e) A is charged with theft and with having been
    previously convicted of theft. The previous conviction is relevant
    as a fact in issue.\
(e) A is tried for the murder of B. The fact that B prosecuted A for
    libel and that A was convicted and sentenced is relevant under
    section 8 as showing the motive for the fact in issue.\]

particular classes of people,\
the opinions of persons having special means of knowledge thereon are,
relevant facts. 50. Opinion on relationship, when relevant. ----When the
Court has to form an opinion as to the relationship of one person to
another, the opinion, expressed by conduct, as to the existence of such
relationship, of any person who, as a member of the family or otherwise,
has special means of knowledge on the subject, is a relevant fact:
Provided that such opinion shall not be sufficient to prove a marriage
in proceedings under the Indian Divorce Act, 1869 (4 of 1869), or in
prosecutions under section 494, 495, 497 or 498 of the Indian Penal Code
(45 of 1860). Illustrations (a) The question is, whether A and B, were

52. In civil cases character to prove conduct imputed, irrelevant.----In

    otherwise relevant.
